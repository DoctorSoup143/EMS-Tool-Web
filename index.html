At this time, a large foreign body was visualized and removed with a straight stat. The area was carefully inspected for any remaining piece of foreign body. The area was palpated and there was no more remaining foreign body noted. There was no purulent drainage expressed. Area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Pulse lavage was performed with 3 liters of plain sterile saline. Wound cultures were obtained, aerobic and aerobic. The wound was then again inspected for any remaining foreign body or purulent drainage. None was noticed at this time. The wound was packed with sterile new gauze, and dressings consisted of 4x4s, ABDs, Kling, and Kerlix. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.
